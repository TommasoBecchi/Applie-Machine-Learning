# Applied-Machine-Learning

Machine learning project based on a supervised machine learning problem.
In this project, the results were btained using a Linear Regression model and a Ridge Regression model and they were compared to understand which one best predicts the output starting from the input data.
A Random Forest Regressor is also used to study if it gives better results than the previous linear models.
